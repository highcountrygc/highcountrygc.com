Every room in this house is designed to let in the beautiful view. David designed and built this luxury home to both functional and beautiful. It is also environmentally friendly. It features maple floors and ceilings from maple trees cut down on the property and insulation that exceeds the building code. The modern, open floor plan gives this house a spacious feel for its size, while its finishes remind you that you are in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. The great room features custom architectural trusses, a prow front, and custom kitchen. The home also features a central vacuum and beautiful covered deck. This home is comfortable to live in and impresses every guest.
